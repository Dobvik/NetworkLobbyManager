# Network-Manager

## Dependencies
### [Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror)
Network-Manager is obviously dependant on Mirror which is a streamline, bug fixed, maintained version of UNET for Unity.
### [FizzySteamworks](https://github.com/Dobtyk/FizzySteamworks)
FizzySteamworks is a Steam P2P transport for Mirror, it utilizes Steam's P2P service to directly connect or relay your connection to another player.

### [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET)
FizzySteamworks relies on Steamworks.NET to communicate with the Steamworks API, so you will need that installed and initalized properly before you can use this transport.
